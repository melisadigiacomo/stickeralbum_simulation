# Filling a sticker album simulation: Project Overview 
* This code calculates how many stickers do we have to buy in order to fill a sticker album.

## Code and Resources Used 
**Pyhton Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** numpy, random


## Mathematic problem
Simplifying the problem, it was assumed that the all stickers are printed the same number of times and that they have an uniform random distribution in the packages. The are no sticker changes with collectors.

## Simulation
Easy functions were developed to simulation the filling of a sticker album. 

# Copa America Sticker Album
The *Copa América 2021* sticker album was selected to try the simulation. *Copa América* is a football american tournament that had Argentina as the 2021 champion.

* With a total number of 400 stickers in the album, you need to buy **2653 stickers** on average to fill it.
* It represents **531 packages**. 
* Total price: **US$318**
